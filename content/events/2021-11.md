We didn't record the salon, but we shared ideas around what it would look like if everyone in the bay area had enough resources. There were many ideas from a living wage for all teachers, guaranteed housing, increased access to 24 hour restrooms, and more. One of the things that I like to advocate for especially as a foundation is a [guaranteed income](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-guaranteed-minimum-income). There are pilot programs happening across the [country](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/), [state](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/there-s-so-much-need-l-chicago-launch-nation-s-n1283368), and even in [San Francisco](https://www.guaranteedinc.org/) and throughout the [Bay Area](https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/bay-area-guaranteed-income-programs/). You can find [resources](https://fundforhumanity.org/), [grassroots orgs](https://www.miraclemessages.org/), [advocacy groups](https://www.levelupcalifornia.org/about/policy-platform), and [organizations](https://insightcced.org/about/our-story/) that support the efforts all over.
