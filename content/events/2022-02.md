[**Kate Lewin**](https://medium.com/@klewinwriting) is a Bay Area born educator, stepmom and sometimes poet. Manic depressive pixie dream girl and lover of true crime and anything pink. You can find her words at *Lady Clever, Guff, Bold Italic*, and others. If you look deep enough into her eyes, you can see how the universe began—not with “let there be light,” but a bang.
