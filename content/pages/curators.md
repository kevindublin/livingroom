[**Giovanna Lomanto**](http://giovannalomanto.com/) is a Bay Area poet and teaching artist with a passion for investigating self-liberation through the arts. An alumnus of U.C. Berkeley and a current MFA candidate at NYU's low-residency program, she finds power in education, and therefore holds a passion for delivering that same power to youth—in classrooms, workshops, and mentorships. Her work has been featured on KALW, the Worth-Ryder Art Gallery, the Flor y Canto Literary Festival, Box, and the Elevation Review. She is the author of two poetry collections: [*no body in particular*](https://www.thescrambler.com/no-body-in-particular.html) (Scrambler Books, 2019) and *jupiter fell out the sky last night* (Bound to Brew, 2021).
