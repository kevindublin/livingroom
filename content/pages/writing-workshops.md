# The Living Room Writing Workshops

The Living Room Writing Workshops are in a unique *"Montage Style."* This means that each sequence of workshops has a unifying theme, i.e. *Crafting a Poetry Practice* or *Craft of Creative Writing*, but each week is independent. This means you don't need to attend all three, but it can be beneficial. The Montage Style also means that **each 3 hour workshop has 2-3 sections and usually 2-3 instructors** with different lessons and perspectives. All instructors are published writers who perform or showcase their work in public.

The Living Room SF is focused on cultivating writers and writing community, so you can expect the workshops to be part craft instruction, part active writing exercises, and part writing practice. There will be resources shared for building your life as a writer in each section.

### What does scholarship-first mean?
Accessibility is important to us, so our workshops are scholarship-first. Meaning, we prioritize cost-free and half-off scholarships of our workshops for writers who have a less-than-stable income and who are at various stages of their writing practice in order to maintain support for a diverse group of writers.

### How do scholarships work? 

Each workshop is capped at 12 participants. At least half of those spaces are reserved for those who have scholarships of some kind. Scholarships take into account the Living Room SF's mission and priotity communities. Applications close the day after the sequence begins. Scholarships are also on a first come, first served basis. Please apply early if interested. If you have any questions, use the [contact form](https://thelivingroomsf.com/contact/).

### What is on the scholarship application?

- Do you have a less than stable income?
- Do you identify as a writer in a historically underrepresented community: BIPOC, neurodivergent, senior, LGBTQ+, or formerly-incarcerated?
- What would you like to gain from this workshop? (under 50 words)
- Field to include a link to a writing sample

### Where do the workshops take place?

At [Syzygy SF](https://thelivingroomsf.com/venue/), which is at the intersection of 15th Street and South Van Ness. Walk over or bike if you're in the neighborhood (bike rack available). You can take BART to 16th & Mission and walk. There are also usually a few parking spots in a 2 block radius.
