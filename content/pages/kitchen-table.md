## About Kitchen Table

Created by Paolo Bicchieri & Lucie Pereira, co-produced with Kevin Dublin, [Kitchen Table](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kitchen-table-2023-tickets-499332245187?aff=livingroom) is a quarterly series centered on poetry and literature, food and drink, and culture and politics. The core of the series are the questions: *What feeds your body?* *What feeds your mind?* Two poets and one food writer share their work and have conversations with each other and the audience as we all share a local pop-up's food or drink. The series was piloted in September and November of 2022 and continues in 2023 with shows on **January 13**, **April 14**, **July 14**, and **October 13** at 7pm.
