About the Series

Join us in our living room. We live in polarizing times. From the deep fisures of politics to cancel culture, we hear conversation after coversation or see image after image of someone questioning someone else's humanity online and in our everyday lives. What we can't seem to do as a society is agree on anything. And the ties of being brother or sister, mother or daughter, neighbor or co-worker or fellow citizen seem to mean less and less. What the Living Room: Reading Series & Salon strives to be is a welcoming space for all people to come together and discuss large topics of the day through art, open discussion, and the recognition of each person's humanity.

Each hour long event will have a theme and a community partner that we support, some upcoming themes include: Home, Economic Security, Afrofuturism, Diaspora/Homeland, Gentrification, Data, and Mindfulness.

Most events will have the structure:

- 4 minutes introduction to theme, readers, & community partner
- 1 minute group deep breathing
- 15-20 minutes first set of readers
- 15 minutes open discussion of theme, mingling over drinks, community partner shoutout
- 10-15 minutes second set of readers
- 2 minute close and invitation for food & drinks, final community partner shoutout

If you had to sum up the spirt of the show in  a poem, it might come closest with "The Guest House" by Jal훮l ad-D카n Mohammad R큰m카, the 13th century Persian poet who reminds us to welcome, be grateful for the full range of human emotion and experience because of what it might lead to, and to be empathetic to others who may be experiencing a guest different than your own at the moment:

<strong>The Guest House | Rumi</strong>, <em>translation by Coleman Barks</em>

This being human is a guest house.<br/>
Every morning a new arrival.<br/>
<br/>
A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br/>
some momentary awareness comes<br/>
as an unexpected visitor.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome and entertain them all!<br/>
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br/>
who violently sweep your house<br/>
empty of its furniture,<br/>
still, treat each guest honorably.<br/>
He may be clearing you out<br/>
for some new delight.<br/>
<br/>
The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br/>
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.<br/>
<br/>
Be grateful for whatever comes.<br/>
because each has been sent<br/>
as a guide from beyond.<br/>
<br/>
