## About the Living Room

The Living Room cultivates Bay Area writers, literary community, and productive dialogue in San Francisco with a focus on economic equity since October 2021. Founded by <a href="https://kevindublin.com/" target="_blank">Kevin Dublin</a>, the Living Room believes in people and the power of education, art, and community to make lasting positive changes in the world. The vision is to serve as an incubator and community-building program for writers to make being a full-time writer accessible by directly paying writers, and connecting them with other organizations which can provide economic opportunities as the cost-of-living rises and the artistic community recovers from the pandemic.

Our first and signature program is the free monthly reading series & salon at Syzygy SF in San Francisco’s Mission district on the fourth Friday of each month. The Living Room also connects writers with established literary organizations and collectives through partnerships. In the first year, the Living Room was able to feature and pay 77 Writers over 21 events, partner with 4 arts organizations, gain exposure to 4 small pop-up food vendors, support 3 community partners, feature in 2 festivals, and celebrate historic and contemporary Black poets at the Kimpton Alton Hotel.

Eternal gratitude to [The Artist Power Convenings](https://ybca.org/artist-power-convenings/) initiative at [Yerba Buena Center for the Arts](https://ybca.org/) for the grant that allowed us to pay our first season of readers and get the show started. I found out about the opportunity through their platform, the [Artist Power Center](https://ybca.org/artist-power-center/) which shares opportunities for local artists. You can [join the APC here](https://artistpowercenter.org/). You are greatly appreciated, [YBCA](https://www.instagram.com/ybca/)!
