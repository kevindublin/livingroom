## About the Series

![photo of Feb 2022 Show](../static/images/rebirth_show.jpg)

Join us in the living room at Syzygy on the Fourth Friday of each month for intimate poetry performances, ideas, and conversation. Based in the Mission district of San Francisco, Each 90 minute event has a theme, set of at least five poets, 15 minute intermission of open discussion about a question that affects Bay Area residents or the world at-large. Quarterly, we have a [community partner](https://thelivingroomsf.com/partners/) who uplifts vulnerable populations that we spotlight to help raise awareness and solicit donations of funds or time for the cause.

You can see previous themes on the [homepage](https://thelivingroomsf.com/). Some upcoming themes include: Renewal, Excellence, Education, and Cruelty.

Most events will have the structure:

- 2 minutes introduction to theme
- 3 minutes word from community partner
- 15-20 minutes first set of readers
- 15 minutes open discussion of theme among audience
- 10-15 minutes second set of readers
- 2 minute in closing and final community partner shoutout

If you had to sum up the spirt of the show in a poem, it might come closest with "The Guest House" by Jal훮l ad-D카n Mohammad R큰m카, the 13th century Persian poet who reminds us to welcome, be grateful for the full range of human emotion and experience because of what it might lead to, and to be empathetic to others who may be experiencing a guest different than your own at the moment:

---

<strong>The Guest House | Rumi</strong>, <em>translation by Coleman Barks</em>

This being human is a guest house.<br/>
Every morning a new arrival.<br/>
<br/>
A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br/>
some momentary awareness comes<br/>
as an unexpected visitor.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome and entertain them all!<br/>
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br/>
who violently sweep your house<br/>
empty of its furniture,<br/>
still, treat each guest honorably.<br/>
He may be clearing you out<br/>
for some new delight.<br/>
<br/>
The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br/>
meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.<br/>
<br/>
Be grateful for whatever comes.<br/>
because each has been sent<br/>
as a guide from beyond.<br/>
<br/>
