&lt;h2&gt;The Mission&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Living Room SF produces engaging community experiences, publications, and fosters partnerships to develop economic opportunities for Bay Area writers with unstable incomes and a primary focus on BIPOC writers in order to cultivate literary community, productive dialogue on topics that affect Bay Area Residents, and increase social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Living Room SF is a community, an incubator for writers and their ideas, a business, and an opportunity to connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Programs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Living Room Reading Series &amp;amp; Salon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kitchen Table Reading Series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pop-up events with community sponsors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnerships with Bay Area festivals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scholarship-funded in-person workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentary poetry film explorations on the history of Black poets in San Francisco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for Black poets living in San Francisco, including scholarship-funded workshops &amp;amp; a mutual aid fund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forthcoming literary anthologies &amp;amp; community micro press workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More interdisciplinary art experiences, including prescriptive arts: Poetry Therapy &amp;amp; Mindfulness events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online community for convenings, workshops, and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual archive of San Francisco writers &amp;amp; events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing retreat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Living Room connects writers with established literary organizations and collectives through partnerships. In 2022, we were able to feature and pay 77 Writers over 21 events, partner with 4 arts organizations, gain exposure for 4 small pop-up food vendors, support 3 community partners, feature in 2 festivals, and celebrate historic and contemporary Black poets at a boutique hotel. In 2023, we've done even more. Stay tuned for a community report. &lt;/p&gt;
